Volunteer Hub is a volunteer coordination system that allows organizations to create projects and opportunities that people can then browse and select to volunteer for the organizations.

Organizations create a profile and can add large projects as well as individual volunteering opportunities. Users can then search through available tasks and can select and assign themselves to tasks that they are qualified for.

If an organization has a task that requires training or acceptance of the volunteer's application, the volunteer can easily make a request to the opportunity and an employee of the organization can approve or deny their request.

The website and Android application work together to access the same database.
